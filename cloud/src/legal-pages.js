<h1>Make your stream chat easier to follow.</h1>
<p>ChatVoice is a Windows desktop app that reads YouTube, Twitch, and Kick chat aloud, with moderation controls, OBS overlays, music playback, Discord role tools, and optional YouTube and Twitch chat actions.</p>
<div class="card"><h2>Platform sign-in</h2>
<p>If you connect a YouTube or Twitch account, ChatVoice uses the requested permissions to send chat messages and create polls on your behalf. You can disconnect from the platform card in the app. Read the <a href="/privacy">privacy policy</a> for details.</p>
<h2>Get the app</h2><p>ChatVoice is distributed through its <a href="https://github.com/Deba-dev/ChatVoice">GitHub project</a>. Builds and availability are managed by the project maintainer.</p></div>
<h2>Public information</h2><p>Read the <a href="/privacy">privacy policy</a> and <a href="/terms">terms of service</a>, or contact <a href="mailto:${CONTACT}">${CONTACT}</a>.</p>
<p class="updated">ChatVoice cloud service and project information.</p>`),
  "/privacy": () => layout("Privacy policy", "How ChatVoice handles information in its desktop app and cloud services.",
    `<p class="eyebrow">Privacy policy</p><h1>Your data and ChatVoice</h1>
<p class="updated">Effective October 8, 2026</p>
<p>This policy explains how the ChatVoice desktop application and its optional Cloudflare services handle information. ChatVoice is maintained by its project developer. Questions or deletion requests: <a href="mailto:${CONTACT}">${CONTACT}</a>.</p>
<h2>Information stored on your device</h2>
<p>ChatVoice stores your preferences and feature configuration in your Windows user profile, including channel names, moderation and voice settings, music-folder location, overlay and integration settings, and any account session handles you choose to save. YouTube, Twitch, and Kick chat used for local reading is processed by the app to provide its features. ChatVoice does not send ordinary chat-reading content to its cloud service.</p>
<p>On Windows, platform session handles are protected with Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) when available; if protection is unavailable, the app falls back to its regular local settings storage. Local files remain on your device unless you choose to share or back them up.</p>
<h2>YouTube and Twitch sign-in</h2>
<p>If you connect an account, ChatVoice receives the provider's account identifier and display name and stores access and refresh tokens encrypted in the Cloudflare D1 database. The cloud keeps a hash of the app session handle rather than the handle itself. Short-lived sign-in state and hand-off tickets are stored in Cloudflare KV and expire automatically.</p>
<p>These permissions are used to check your connected account and, when you request it, send a chat message or create a poll through the relevant platform API. ChatVoice does not use these tokens for advertising. Disconnecting in the app revokes the provider authorization and deletes the associated cloud account record. You can also revoke access in your Google or Twitch account settings.</p>
<h2>Discord and streamer service data</h2>
<p>If you use Discord features, the cloud stores Discord server identifiers and names, feature configuration, role and invite rules, invite-use tracking, and platform-to-Discord account links needed to provide those features. Temporary Discord login codes expire automatically. Server configuration and account links remain until the service operator deletes them; email us to request removal.</p>
<h2>Payment alert data</h2>
<p>ChatVoice does not process or hold payments. If you configure payment alerts, your payment provider sends webhook data needed to display an alert, such as a transaction identifier, time, display name, message, amount, and currency. When a webhook is processed, alert records older than three days are cleaned up; if no later webhook is received, cleanup may occur later. Payment credentials supplied to configure webhook verification are stored in the cloud service configuration and are used to validate webhook requests.</p>
<h2>Service providers and sharing</h2>
<p>Cloudflare provides the Worker, KV, and D1 infrastructure. Google/YouTube, Twitch, and Discord receive requests necessary for the platform features you use. Your selected payment provider sends webhook events to the configured service. These providers handle information under their own terms and privacy policies. ChatVoice does not sell personal information or use it for targeted advertising.</p>
<p>Cloudflare and other providers may process technical information such as IP address, request time, and browser or device details to deliver, secure, and operate their services, subject to their own policies.</p>
<h2>Retention and your choices</h2>
<p>Platform account records are kept until you disconnect or request deletion. Payment alert records are kept for up to three days. Discord configuration and account-link records are retained while those features are set up, unless removed on request. Local app settings can be removed by uninstalling ChatVoice and deleting its data folder under <code>%APPDATA%\\ChatVoice</code>.</p>
<p>To request deletion of cloud data or ask a privacy question, email <a href="mailto:${CONTACT}">${CONTACT}</a>. Include enough detail to identify the relevant service or account, but do not email passwords, OAuth tokens, or other secrets.</p>
<h2>Children and policy changes</h2>
<p>ChatVoice is a general-purpose tool for streamers and is not designed to collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information through a ChatVoice service, contact us so we can review and remove it.</p>
<p>This policy may be updated as ChatVoice changes. The effective date above will be revised when material changes are made.</p>`),
  "/terms": () => layout("Terms of service", "Terms for using the ChatVoice desktop application and cloud features.",
    `<p class="eyebrow">Terms of service</p><h1>Using ChatVoice</h1>
<p class="updated">Effective October 8, 2026</p>
<p>By installing or using ChatVoice, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the application or its cloud features. Questions: <a href="mailto:${CONTACT}">${CONTACT}</a>.</p>
<h2>What ChatVoice provides</h2>
<p>ChatVoice is a desktop application and optional cloud service for reading livestream chat, moderation support, overlays, music playback, Discord role features, payment alerts from a streamer's own provider, and optional YouTube or Twitch chat actions. Features may change, be unavailable, or be discontinued.</p>
<h2>Your accounts and content</h2>
<p>You are responsible for securing your device and accounts, choosing appropriate settings, and ensuring that you have permission to use the content, accounts, and services you connect. Messages and polls are submitted to YouTube or Twitch only when you request them; you remain responsible for their content and compliance with applicable platform rules.</p>
<p>ChatVoice does not process payments. Payment alerts depend on your own payment provider, webhook configuration, and internet connectivity. You are responsible for verifying your payment setup and for any payments or refunds handled by that provider.</p>
<h2>Third-party services</h2>
<p>YouTube, Google, Twitch, Discord, Cloudflare, and payment providers are independent services with their own terms, privacy practices, availability, and enforcement decisions. ChatVoice is not affiliated with or endorsed by them. Your use of each service is also governed by that provider's terms.</p>
<h2>Music and other third-party materials</h2>
<p>You are responsible for confirming that you have the necessary rights for any music or other material you play or distribute. Links or license information provided in ChatVoice are for convenience and do not guarantee that a stream will avoid copyright claims or platform action. Do not redistribute third-party files unless their license permits it.</p>
<h2>Acceptable use</h2>
<p>Do not use ChatVoice to violate laws, infringe others' rights, bypass platform safeguards, abuse connected services, or interfere with the service or other users. You are responsible for reviewing messages, moderation actions, and account permissions before relying on them.</p>
<h2>Availability and warranty</h2>
<p>ChatVoice is provided on an “as available” basis, without guarantees that it will be uninterrupted, error-free, or suitable for a particular purpose. To the extent permitted by law, the project maintainer disclaims implied warranties. Nothing in these terms excludes rights or liability that cannot legally be excluded.</p>
<h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
<p>To the extent permitted by law, the project maintainer is not liable for indirect or consequential loss, loss of data, lost revenue, stream interruption, or actions taken by third-party platforms arising from use of ChatVoice. This does not limit liability that applicable law does not allow to be limited.</p>
<h2>Changes and contact</h2>
<p>These terms may be updated when the application or its services change. Continued use after updated terms are posted means you accept them to the extent permitted by law. Contact <a href="mailto:${CONTACT}">${CONTACT}</a> with questions.</p>`)
